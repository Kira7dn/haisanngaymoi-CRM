## Architecture Compliance
✅ Follows Clean Architecture with strict layer separation
✅ Uses dependency injection via `depends.ts` factory pattern
✅ Domain entities are pure TypeScript with business logic
✅ Use cases follow class-based pattern with Request/Response interfaces
✅ Repository implements complex MongoDB aggregation pipelines
✅ UI uses Server Actions for data fetching

## 🔍 RFM Segmentation Logic

### 11 RFM Segments

1. **Champions** (555, 554, 544, 545)
   - Best customers: Recent, frequent, high value
   - Action: Reward, upsell, ask for referrals

2. **Loyal Customers** (543, 444, 435, 355, 354, 345)
   - Regular buyers with good value
   - Action: Engage, cross-sell

3. **Potential Loyalists** (553, 551, 552, 541, 542, 533, 532, 531)
   - Recent customers with potential
   - Action: Build relationship, increase frequency

4. **New Customers** (512, 511, 422, 421, 412, 411, 311)
   - Recent first-time buyers
   - Action: Onboard, provide support

5. **Promising** (525, 524, 523, 522, 521, 515, 514, 513)
   - Recent buyers, need to increase frequency
   - Action: Create engagement campaigns

6. **Need Attention** (535, 534, 443, 434, 343, 334, 325, 324)
   - Decent customers showing decline
   - Action: Reactivation campaigns

7. **About to Sleep** (331, 321, 312, 221, 213, 231, 241, 251)
   - Below average recency and frequency
   - Action: Win-back campaigns

8. **At Risk** (255, 254, 245, 244, 253, 252, 243, 242, 235, 234)
   - Good customers going inactive
   - Action: Urgent reactivation

9. **Cannot Lose Them** (155, 154, 144, 214, 215, 115, 114, 113)
   - High value but inactive
   - Action: Premium win-back offers

10. **Hibernating** (332, 322, 231, 241, 251, 233, 232, 223, 222)
    - Low value, going inactive
    - Action: Low-cost reactivation

11. **Lost** (111, 112, 121, 131-142, 151, 152, 133, 123, 122)
    - Lowest scores across all dimensions
    - Action: Ignore or last-chance offers

## 🧪 Churn Risk Thresholds

### Default Configuration
```typescript
{
  highRiskDays: 90,    // No purchase in 90+ days = high risk
  mediumRiskDays: 60,  // No purchase in 60-89 days = medium risk
  lowRiskDays: 30      // No purchase in 30-59 days = low risk
}
```

### Customizable
Can be adjusted per business needs via `ChurnRiskThresholds` parameter in queries.

## 🚀 How to Access

1. **Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   - Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
   - Click "Customer Analytics" card
   - Or direct URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard/analytics/customer`

3. **Default View:**
   - Date Range: Last 30 days
   - All churn risk levels shown (high + medium)
   - Top 100 RFM segments

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Parallel data fetching (all metrics loaded simultaneously)
- MongoDB aggregation on database server
- Indexed queries on `customerId` and `createdAt`
- Limits on result sets (RFM: 100, Churn: 50)

### Recommended Indexes
```javascript
// Add to MongoDB
db.customers.createIndex({ tier: 1 });
db.orders.createIndex({ customerId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
db.orders.createIndex({ createdAt: 1, status: 1, paymentStatus: 1 });
```

## 📝 Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **RFM Implementation** - Classic RFM with quartile-based scoring (industry standard)

2. **Churn Risk Thresholds** - Configurable thresholds based on business context (90/60/30 days default for seafood products with perishable nature)

3. **Cohort Analysis** - Month-based cohorts (can be extended to week-based)

4. **Parallel Fetching** - All analytics loaded in parallel for better UX

### Known Limitations
- Favorite categories simplified (uses product names instead of actual categories)
- Cohort analysis limited to 24 periods
- No real-time updates (manual refresh)
- Contact action placeholder (needs CRM integration)

### Future Enhancements
- Add cohort retention heatmap visualization
- Implement customer journey mapping
- Add predictive churn modeling (ML)
- Customer lifetime value prediction
- Automated win-back campaigns
- Customer communication history integration
- A/B testing for retention campaigns
- Custom RFM scoring rules
- Export customer segments for marketing tools
